Specialized in signal processing, I developed a method to automatically identify behavior of sea turtle from bio-loggers based on deep learning. I am convinced that mathematics and new technologies are valuable tools to improve our knowledge on biodiversity and thus better protect it.","location":{"address":"5 Melrose road","postalCode":"7945 Muizenberg","city":"Cape Town","countryCode":"SA"},"profiles":[{"network":"Twitter","username":"AlberEinstein","url":"https://twitter.com/AlbertEinstein"}]},"work":[{"name":"African Institute for Mathematical Sciences - AIMS South Africa","position":"Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Machine Learning for Ecology","url":"https://https://aims.ac.za/","startDate":"2022-04-01","endDate":"2026-03-30","summary":"My research focuses on developing user-friendly tools powered by deep learning, with the primary goal of supporting wildlife monitoring and streamlining data processing in ecological research ","highlights":["biologging","bioacoustics"]}],"education":[{"institution":"DEPE‑IPHC ‑ Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","location":"Strasbourg, France","url":"https://www.uzh.ch/","area":"Behavioral Ecology","studyType":"PhD","title":"Title : Automatic identification of behaviors from bio-loggers: a solution to improve knowledge on sea turtle ecology?
