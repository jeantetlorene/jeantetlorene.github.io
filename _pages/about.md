It is during my PhD at Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in France that I discovered the world of deep learning while developing a model to automatically identify underwater behaviors of sea turtles from bio-loggers (animal-borne sensors). 

This experience ignited a passion within me to further enhance my expertise in deep learning, particularly in its application to conservation efforts. Currently, my research revolves around the creation of user-friendly tools based on deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to facilitate wildlife monitoring and streamline data processing in the field of ecology.
