  abstract = {Accelerometers are becoming ever more important sensors in animalattached technology, providing data that allow determination of body posture and movement and thereby helping to elucidate behaviour in animals that are difficult to observe. We sought to validate the identification of sea turtle behaviours from accelerometer signals by deploying tags on the carapace of a juvenile loggerhead (Caretta caretta), an adult hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and an adult green turtle (Chelonia mydas) at Aquarium La Rochelle, France. We recorded tri-axial acceleration at 50 Hz for each species for a full day while two fixed cameras recorded their behaviours. We identified behaviours from the acceleration data using two different supervised learning algorithms, Random Forest and Classification And Regression Tree ({CART}), treating the data from the adult animals as separate from the juvenile data. We achieved a global accuracy of 81.30\% for the adult hawksbill and green turtle {CART} model and 71.63\% for the juvenile loggerhead, identifying 10 and 12 different behaviours, respectively. Equivalent figures were 86.96\% for the adult hawksbill and green turtle Random Forest model and 79.49\% for the juvenile loggerhead, for the same behaviours. The use of Random Forest combined with {CART} algorithms allowed us to understand the decision rules implicated in behaviour discrimination, and thus remove or group together some ‘confused’ or under-represented behaviours in order to get the most accurate models. This study is the first to validate accelerometer data to identify turtle behaviours and the approach can now be tested on other captive sea turtle species.},

	abstract = {The identification of sea turtle behaviours is a prerequisite to predicting the activities and time-budget of these animals in their natural habitat over the long term. However, this is hampered by a lack of reliable methods that enable the detection and monitoring of certain key behaviours such as feeding. This study proposes a combined approach that automatically identifies the different behaviours of free-ranging sea turtles through the use of animal-borne multi-sensor recorders (accelerometer, gyroscope and time-depth recorder), validated by animal-borne video-recorder data. We show here that the combination of supervised learning algorithms and multi-signal analysis tools can provide accurate inferences of the behaviours expressed, including feeding and scratching behaviours that are of crucial ecological interest for sea turtles. Our procedure uses multi-sensor miniaturized loggers that can be deployed on free-ranging animals with minimal disturbance. It provides an easily adaptable and replicable approach for the long-term automatic identification of the different activities and determination of time-budgets in sea turtles. This approach should also be applicable to a broad range of other species and could significantly contribute to the conservation of endangered species by providing detailed knowledge of key animal activities such as feeding, travelling and resting.},

	abstract={Artificial neural networks are powerful supervised learning algorithms that are based on deep learning and have been poorly exploited in movement ecology.In this study, we adapt a fully convolutional neural network that was originally developed for biomedical 3D image segmentation: the V-net. We test it on a labelled dataset collected from animal-borne video recorders combined with multi-sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes and depth recorders) deployed on free-ranging immature green turtles (Chelonia mydas). The proposed model, fitted for 1D data, is able to predict six behavioural categories for green turtles with an AUC score of 88%. Thus, diverted from its initial purpose and tested on sea turtle, the V-net is a very efficient method of behavioural identification that should be easily generalized to a wide range of species.},

	abstract = {Here we propose a new machine learning algorithm for classification of human activities by means of accelerometer and gyroscope signals. Based on a novel hierarchical system of logistic regression classifiers and a relatively small set of features extracted from the filtered signals, the proposed algorithm outperformed previous work on the {DaLiAc} (Daily Life Activity) and {mHealth} datasets. The algorithm also represents a significant improvement in terms of computational costs and requires no feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning. The algorithm still showed a robust performance with only two (ankle and wrist) out of the four devices (chest, wrist, hip and ankle) placed on the body (96.8\% vs. 97.3\% mean accuracy for the {DaLiAc} dataset). The present work shows that low-complexity models can compete with heavy, inefficient models in classification of advanced activities when designed with a careful upstream inspection of the data.},

	abstract = {The change of animal biometrics (body mass and body size) can reveal important information about their living environment as well as determine the survival potential and reproductive success of individuals and thus the persistence of populations. However, weighing individuals like marine turtles in the field presents important logistical difficulties. In this context, estimating body mass ({BM}) based on body size is a crucial issue. Furthermore, the determinants of the variability of the parameters for this relationship can provide information about the quality of the environment and the manner in which individuals exploit the available resources. This is of particular importance in young individuals where growth quality might be a determinant of adult fitness. Our study aimed to validate the use of different body measurements to estimate {BM}, which can be difficult to obtain in the field, and explore the determinants of the relationship between {BM} and size in juvenile green turtles. Juvenile green turtles were caught, measured, and weighed over 6 years (2011–2012; 2015–2018) at six bays to the west of Martinique Island (Lesser Antilles). Using different datasets from this global database, we were able to show that the {BM} of individuals can be predicted from body measurements with an error of less than 2\%. We built several datasets including different morphological and time-location information to test the accuracy of the mass prediction. We show a yearly and north–south pattern for the relationship between {BM} and body measurements. The year effect for the relationship of {BM} and size is strongly correlated with net primary production but not with sea surface temperature or cyclonic events. We also found that if the bay locations and year effects were removed from the analysis, the mass prediction degraded slightly but was still less than 3\% on average. Further investigations of the feeding habitats in Martinique turtles are still needed to better understand these effects and to link them with geographic and oceanographic conditions.},
